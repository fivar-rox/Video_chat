# NoobMeet - A Video chat web application
<h3> Intro </h3> 
This is a webRTC based video chatting web application. The users can register and get logged in to their user page. They can either create a new room or use their previous rooms to join a call and chat. This implementation also consists of a real time chat and file share functionality.

(Calls and chats are functional, but becasue of NO "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" on icon package script, fonts-awesome is blocked. So u won't be able to access any incall-features in the deployement. To use all the features, follow the steps in "Getting Started" and run it on a local machine, no problems should arise, but depending on the time, the script source may change, so u have to manually change the source in local machine)
